# Homework04 - Once Upon a Time in Containers #


## Description ##
This homework is an introduction to containers where we used Docker to containerize code that analyzes Meteorite Landings data. This homework had us use a file called ml_data_analysis.py to read in data from Meteorite_Landings.json and output summarized information from the json file. A file called test_ml_data_analysis.py was then created with unit tests to test three functions from ml_data_analysis.py, compute_average_mass(), check_hempishpere(), and count_classes().

### Files ###
Dockerfile is the file that containerizes the ml_data_analysis.py script.

------

ml_data_analysis.py is the python3 file that was altered so that it summarizes the Meteorite Landing data from a file entered through the command line.

------

test_ml_data_analysis.py is the python3 file that houses the unit tests for ml_data_analysis.py.

------

Meteorite_Landings.json is the json file that contains Meteorite Landing data.

#### How to Run the Code using Docker ####
Build the docker file using the following command
------
docker build -t username/ml_data_analysis:1.0 -f Dockerfile .
------
Run the docker file using the following command
------
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/data username/ml_data_analysis:1.0 ml_data_analysis.py /data/ml.json
