# Description #

This homework is an introduction to containers where we used Docker to containerize code that analyzes Meteorite Landings data. This homework had us use a file called ml_data_analysis.py to read in data from Meteorite_Landings.json and output summarized information from the json file. A file called test_ml_data_analysis.py was then created with unit tests to test three functions from ml_data_analysis.py, compute_average_mass(), check_hempishpere(), and count_classes().
