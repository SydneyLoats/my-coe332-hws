==============================
This homework serves as an introduction to python and git to familiarize ourselves with the commands and syntax.

Files
-----
This folder contains two files, `exercise1.py` and `exercise2.py`. 

1. `exercise1.py` has a function that determines if integers in a list are even or odd. A list is initialized and the function is called on the list.

2. `exercise2.py` has a function that outputs all prime numbers 3 through 100.

Run the Code

Type `python3 <file name>` into the command line for each file to run the code.
