Introduction to Python and Git
==============================
This homework serves as an introduction to python and git to familiarize ourselves with the commands and syntax.
This folder contains two files, exercise1.py and exercise2.py. The Python script labeled exercise1.py has a function that determines if integers in a list are even or odd. A list is initialized and the function is called on the list. The Python script labeled exercise2.py has a function that outputs all prime numbers 3 through 100. I then pushed these files to this github directory for homework01.
